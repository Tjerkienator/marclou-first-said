The goal of this story is to prepare the project for migration to Heroku. This involves connecting the GitHub repository to a Heroku app to create the project. A decision must be made on whether the Poetry lock and pyproject.toml files can be used directly on Heroku or if a separate requirements file needs to be created. If a separate file is necessary, it must be generated from the Poetry environment files. Additionally, all other required Heroku files, such as the Procfile and any other dependencies, must be added.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The GitHub repository is successfully connected to a Heroku app.
- A decision is made on whether the Poetry files can be used directly or if a separate requirements file is needed.
- If necessary, the requirements file is created from the Poetry environment files.
- The Procfile and all other required Heroku files are added to the project.
